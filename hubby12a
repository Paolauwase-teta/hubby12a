🎯 **About Me**

Hello! I'm UWASE TETA Paola, a creative and detail-oriented frontend developer with a strong passion for building beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks, especially React, and enjoy turning designs into clean, scalable code using tools like Sass, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla CSS.

With each project, I aim to improve usability, enhance user experience, and write maintainable code that meets real-world challenges. I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest in frontend technologies.
